UTF-8 validation is a process that ensures that a sequence of bytes in a given data stream or file adheres to the rules and requirements of the UTF-8 encoding format. UTF-8 is a character encoding scheme widely used to represent and encode characters from the Unicode character set.

Unicode is a universal character set that assigns a unique numerical code to every character in virtually all known scripts and languages, encompassing a vast range of symbols, alphabets, and special characters. UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding that represents Unicode characters using one to four bytes, depending on the character's code point.

UTF-8 validation is essential for correct interpretation and handling of textual data in various software applications, communication protocols, and file formats. It ensures that text encoded in UTF-8 can be processed and displayed accurately, preventing issues like character corruption, misinterpretation, and unintended behavior.

During UTF-8 validation, the following rules are typically checked to confirm the validity of the encoded data:

Code Point Range: UTF-8 encoding allows for characters represented by one to four bytes. During validation, it is confirmed that the byte sequence corresponds to valid Unicode code points and falls within the defined ranges.

Sequence Structure: UTF-8 uses specific bit patterns to represent different character ranges. During validation, it is checked whether the byte sequence follows the correct structure for each character and that there are no incomplete, overlapping, or invalid sequences.

Overlong Encoding: Overlong encoding refers to using more bytes than necessary to represent a character. Valid UTF-8 does not allow this, so validation ensures that no overlong encodings are present.

Invalid Sequences: UTF-8 should not include certain byte sequences that are reserved for specific purposes (e.g., BOM - Byte Order Mark). Validation checks for these invalid sequences to maintain compatibility and correctness.

Security Considerations: UTF-8 validation may also involve checking for potential security risks, such as code injection attacks or other vulnerabilities related to encoding and decoding processes.

In programming languages and libraries, UTF-8 validation functions or methods are often provided to verify the integrity of encoded data. These functions can be used to ensure that strings read from files, received over networks, or entered by users comply with UTF-8 standards and can be processed correctly by the application.

Overall, UTF-8 validation is crucial to ensure proper handling and interpretation of multilingual text and to avoid issues related to character encoding and representation.
