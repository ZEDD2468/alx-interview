0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

Rotating a 2D matrix (also known as a 2D array) is a common programming problem. The goal is to rotate the elements of the matrix by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction. This can be accomplished by performing a series of swaps and transformations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this rotation:

Let's say you have an N x N matrix, where N is the number of rows (and columns) in the matrix.

Transpose the Matrix:
Swap the elements of the matrix along its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right diagonal). This step effectively flips the matrix over its main diagonal.

Reverse Each Row:
After transposing the matrix, reverse the elements of each row. This step completes the rotation by flipping the matrix horizontally.
