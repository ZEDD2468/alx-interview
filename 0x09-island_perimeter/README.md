The "island_perimeter" problem is a common coding challenge that involves finding the perimeter of an island represented as a grid. In this problem, you're given a 2D grid where cells can be either land (represented by 1) or water (represented by 0). Your task is to calculate the perimeter of the island formed by the land cells in the grid.

The perimeter of an island is the total length of the edges surrounding the land cells. Each land cell contributes to the perimeter based on the number of its adjacent water cells.

Here's how you might approach solving the "island_perimeter" problem:

python

<!--Copy code
def island_perimeter(grid):
    perimeter = 0
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if grid[row][col] == 1:
                perimeter += 4  # Start with 4 edges per land cell
                
                # Check left and right neighbors
                if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] == 1:
                    perimeter -= 2  # Subtract 2 for each shared edge
                
                # Check top and bottom neighbors
                if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] == 1:
                    perimeter -= 2
                
    return perimeter-->

In this code, we iterate through each cell in the grid. If the cell contains land (1), we add 4 to the perimeter count (as each land cell contributes 4 edges). Then, we check the neighboring cells to see if they also contain land. If they do, we subtract 2 from the perimeter count for each shared edge.

This solution works by counting the perimeter based on the adjacency of land cells. It takes into account that adjacent land cells share edges, which means we need to subtract the shared edges from the total count.

Keep in mind that the provided code assumes the grid is a valid rectangular 2D array containing either 0 or 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land. Adjustments might be needed depending on the specific input requirements of the problem or the programming language you're using.
